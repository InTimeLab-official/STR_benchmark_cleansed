# STR_benchmark_cleansed

## Download cleansed lmdb dataset for the six benchmarks from 

Despite the widespread use of the six benchmarks (IIIT5k[1], txt recognition, we have noticed that there are mislabeled images in the benchmark. Although \cite{baek2019wrong} provided a version of cleansed labels for benchmark datasets, there are still several mislabeled images. We conduct further verification of these labels. The mislabeled examples can be classified into three types: missing character, alphabetic error, and completely wrong. We will provide the cleansed benchmark datasets to ensure a more accurate evaluation of scene text recognition models.
